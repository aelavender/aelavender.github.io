Summary: >
  Software architect. Pythonista with 10 years of experience. Crafting systems
  to power the next generation of web services.  Guiding your teams to perform
  at their peak.  Harnessing data to change the way your organisation works,
  thinks, and grows.


Expertise:

  - Python for Big Data and Machine Learning (Numpy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn) and
    enterprise web development (Django)

  - Scalable, fault-tolerant architecture for distributed systems (Amazon Web
    Services)

  - Distributed SQL and NoSQL databases for global low-latency data retrieval

  - Modern JavaScript (ECMAScript6/7, React, D3)

  - Functional programming paradigms

  - Git and Github; continuous integration

  - Technical leadership on cross-functional teams


Experience:

  - Organisation:  Monetate, Inc
    Location:  Conshohocken, PA
    Date:  2015-Present
    Title:  Software Architect
    Department:  Product Engineering

    Accomplishments:
      - Led a team of developers, designers, and product managers
      - Developed web APIs capable of serving thousands of requests
        per second to handle rapid data ingestion, instantaneous retrieval,
        real-time analytics, and third-party integrations
      - Initiated a department-wide effort to refactor core infrastructure
        from a closed, monolithic, single-purpose system to an open,
        microservice-oriented, RESTful, extensible platform
      - Designed a flexible, loosely-schematised, distributed data
        architecture, replacing our previous rigidly-defined relational
        data structure, allowing for rapid evolution
      - Raised standards of code quality and readiness for release by
        instilling a culture that prioritised review, testing, and
        documentation, and made time for the cleanup of technical debt
      - 'Contributed across the full stack: client-side JS, web servers,
        algorithms, data management, deployment and monitoring.'
      - Mentored junior developers and facilitated knowledge transfer to
        both technical and non-technical colleagues

  - Organisation:  Susquehanna International Group
    Location:  Bala Cynwyd, PA
    Date:  2007-2015
    Title:  Lead Data Analyst
    Department:  Statistical Options Group

    Accomplishments:
      - Created data-driven models to rapidly predict the value and optimal
        execution strategy for a million options contracts per day from
        leading retail brokerage firms such as E-Trade and Fidelity
      - Drove profit increases of 50% to 100% year-over-year for five years
        running, while more than tripling market share
      - Developed a pipeline for cleaning and matching gigabytes of data per
        day from disparate sources.  This system now underpins much of the
        quantitative analysis in options trading at SIG.
      - Spearheaded research into new order routing algorithms and directly
        advised software developers throughout their implementation, testing,
        release, and evaluation
      - Improved real-time awareness of both business and technical risks
        with new metrics and monitors
      - 'Addressed the needs of disparate groups: traders, quants, developers,
        sales managers, and risk and compliance managers'
